   <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>One of my passions is cars and more precisely : beautiful cars. I enjoy photographing them on the street as soon as I see one. I even created a folder on my phone where I put all the photos I collect. When I get my license and I have enough money, I’d like to buy a nice car and drive the weekend through the streets with the engine roaring. Below you can see some of the cars I took pictures of :

     </div></p>
     <p>The passion that takes me the most time is video games and hardware. I built my own PC Gaming by buying all the components separately. I’m very happy with it! I play with friends almost every night at games like Rocket League (football with cars), or GTA V. Also, if you want to play with me next time, my discord is fryfi_94#4949.

      <p>Finally, another of my hobbies is sport, I have been playing tennis for almost 8 years and swimming for 5 years.</p>

   <h2>Family</h2>
    <p>I have a very large blended family. My father and mother separated when I was three. Since then, my father has remarried with the person who, in fact, became my mother-in-law. She has two sisters who have two children and three children respectively, so I have many cousins because I also have four other cousins who are really in my family. I also have a sister, Ninon, from my father’s first marriage and a half brother, Gaspard, from my father’s second marriage. Ninon is 15 and Gaspard is 9.</p>

   <h2>Professional life</h2>
    <p>Since last November I work at IPESUP, a higher education institution. Every Saturday I am present on site and install video conference rooms. I am also on their fairs as a student representing the Iéseg. Enclosed my CV in English and French.
